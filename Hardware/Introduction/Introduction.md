## Introduction

Watt? is a complete system to measure the power consumption, calculate the energy consumption, control some appliances of the home remotely and send that data to a cloud server. In Watt? we try to smarten up some of the existing physical things like the electricity meter and the electricity plug by connecting them to the *Internet Network*.

## Internet Of Things

The Internet of Things is much talked about and fast becoming a fixture in some industries. The closest to an official definition comes from the Internet of Things Global Standards
Initiative: The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or “things” embedded
with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to
collect and exchange data. That’s a high-level definition, and the IoT goes by other names as
well.
