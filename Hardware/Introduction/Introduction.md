## Introduction

More more embedded devices and sensors are connected to each other and to the Internet. Then the devices can be remotely controllable and their data accessible any where using any kind of devices the users might have. This is the Internet Of Things.

Watt? is a simple implementation of the the Internet Of Things. It features these smart devices all equipped with high current sensors connected with an embedded devices. The devices are connected to a cloud server where it streams the data along with storing it locally in the device. From the cloud server you can access the devices data from any Android mobile device.

Watt? is a system to measure the power consumption, calculate the energy consumption and control some appliances of the home remotely. We are trying to smarten up some existing physical things like electricity meters and electricity plugs by connecting them wireless to the *Internet* and this is the Internet Of Things.

The three major components of our product can be described as the following:

- **Watt? Smart Meter**

  An Internet connected electricity meter to measure the overall power consumption and the cumulative energy consumption of the home. Then to send that data to a back-end cloud server through the Internet.

- **Watt? Smart Plug**

  An external plug to measure the realtime power consumption of the plugged appliance and to make it controllable remotely through an Internet connected mobile device.

- **Watt? Mobile Application**

  The main Interface for the users to deal with all the system features. It makes them able to monitor their power and energy consumptions, control the plugged appliances and expect the bill cost. all of that can be accessed remotely any where.

## Internet Of Things

The closest to an official definition of the Internet Of Things comes from the Internet of Things Global Standards Initiative :

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or “things” embedded
with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to
collect and exchange data. That’s a high-level definition, and the IoT goes by other names as
well.
